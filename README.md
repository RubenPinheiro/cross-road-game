# cross-road-game
an GUI project that generates a game where the player controls a turtle and tries to reach the other side of the screen moving only forward while avoiding randomly generated cars (squares) that are crossing said screen from right to left of the display. When the player is sucessful, a point is awarded.

Challenging project regarding on how to generate a reasonable amount of cars while the player tries to reach the finish line. Decided to implement a counter within the WHILE loop of the main mechanic of the game and everytime said counter reaches a number that is divisible by 4, a new car is generated.
